# Welcome to the TypeScript Bug Tracker
> A full-stack typescript project


## Notes
This is just a challenge for myself to learn TypeScript a little bit better, and to be able to make a fully fleshed out project with a frontend and backend that I create. This is currently incomplete, and if you look hard enough - you'll even notice that the backend is currently using regular JavaScript instead of TypeScript. This will change soon!

This project is currently incomplete and is in the very very beginning stages.
